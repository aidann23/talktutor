                <div class="value-box">
                    <h3><strong>1. Equity in Education</strong></h3>
                    <p><em>“As a community college student, I was eager to grow and push my limits, but I quickly realized that I lacked the resources and support that others had access to. Watching students at four-year universities thrive with tools and guidance that weren’t available to me was frustrating. By leveraging IntervAI, I hope to bridge that gap and ensure students like me get the tools, confidence, and opportunities they deserve, no matter where they are.”</em>        — <strong>Dzinh Pham</strong></p>

                <div class="value-box">
                    <h3><strong>2. Empathy Through Experience</strong></h3>
                    <p><em>“I personally faced the struggles of recruiting as I felt lost, overwhelmed, and anxious about the future of my career. Despite pouring hours into searching for resources, the process still felt confusing and isolating. I knew that there had to be a better way for all students walking this exact same path. By utilizing IntervAI, I intend to help others cultivate confidence in preparations for their next steps in life. ”</em> — <strong>Tue Pham</strong></p>

                <div class="value-box">
                    <h3><strong>3. Collaboration and Community</strong></h3>
                    <p><em>“I find collaboration as one of the most rewarding experiences and aim to extend it further than just creating a tool. My vision for IntervAI is to create an invaluable tool that not only helps individuals master their technical skills but also fosters a supportive community where others create more resources for one another. By contributing IntervAi I aspired to enrich a space where collaboration, growth, and shared success become part of the process.”</em>  — <strong>Aidan Nguyen</strong></p>

                    <h3><strong>4. Purpose-Driven Innovation</strong></h3>
                    <p><em>“I have always thrived in dynamic, hands-on environments, which is why the static online resources often fall short of providing meaningful learning experiences. IntervAI breaks away from the rigidity of traditional study tools by combining a complex framework of adaptive logic with the capabilities of OpenAI. In hopes of helping revolutionize learning, we offer a richer, more interactive environment for all.”</em>   — <strong>Ben Pham</strong></p>
